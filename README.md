Rock paper scissor game in browser

## TODO

- [x] ~Remove bug from the rps logic~
- [x] ~Make some styling~
- [x] ~Refine the logic and the DOM~
- [x] ~Need to find a way for the button not use for loop if possible because it makes the code a bit messy and a bit difficult.~
- [ ] Add reset button to the game
